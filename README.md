# Energy Dashboard UI Project

Welcome to the Energy Dashboard UI project! This repository is part of a larger project focused on monitoring and analyzing energy consumption in real-time. The UI provides a user-friendly interface to visualize various metrics related to energy usage within a room or building, helping users track and manage their energy consumption more effectively.

## Overview

The application allows users to view multiple charts displaying the evolution of energy consumption over time. It also presents key metrics such as average and maximum consumption and manages and displays user capabilities, offering a comprehensive tool for energy management.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast, server-rendered web applications.
- **Shadcn UI**: A component library designed for building modern, responsive UIs.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **reCharts**: For rendering dynamic and interactive charts.


To start working on the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParvanAndrei/unitbv-energy-app.git
   cd unitbv-energy-app

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev

4. **Open your browser**:

    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application. The page will automatically update as you modify files.

## Project Structure

- **/components**: Contains reusable UI components that handle groups of elements, such as charts, side navigation bars, etc.

- **/components/UI**: Basic UI elements like buttons, input fields, and navigation bars that are used across different parts of the application.

- **/app**: Houses different pages corresponding to various routes, along with the main page logic (`page.tsx`). This folder also includes icons and layout components.

## Features

- **Energy Consumption Visualization**: Displays multiple charts that represent energy usage over time.
- **Key Metrics**: Highlights important metrics such as average consumption, maximum consumption, and energy trends.
- **User Management**: Manages user roles and capabilities, ensuring that different users can access and control the features they need.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the UI is accessible and functional on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
